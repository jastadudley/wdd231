          <h2>So, what is Cozy Gaming?</h2>
          <p>Cozy gaming is all about low-stress, emotionally uplifting experiences. These games are often slow-paced, character or story driven, and emphasize comfort, creativity, and calm exploration. Some examples would be farming sims, village builders, soft mystery narratives, and cute crafting mechanics‚Äîlike a warm blanket in game form.</p>
          <p>Studies have shown that gentle gameplay in moderation can reduce stress, improve mood, and even help with focus and mindfulness. There is a world of gorgouse visuals and unforgetable storys to explore- not through books or movies- through gaming!</p>
          <p> Often times video games are advertised as addrinilin</p>
